# snake-game
A browser-based game, providing functionality to the HTML5 &lt;canvas> element through Javascript to draw the snake and respond to user keystrokes. High score comes from the browser's LocalStorage. I have a variety of improvements I plan to make as time allows, including a global scoreboard. Not currently mobile-friendly.
